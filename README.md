### Idea:

#### `Project can enable users to log in and contribute to a dynamic list of the most hated phone features. The list will get customized per user where users can vote on their most disliked features and see the top-rated "worst" features. Adding, updating, or even deleting their submissions would also be possible so even individual hates can be added by users. Accordingly, users would get the list of the least favorite features with a view to individual contribution. This will make an unforgettable experience for everyone.`

##### for examples:

-   ##### "Auto-correct taking over my text"
-   ##### "Too many pre-installed apps"
-   ##### "Battery draining background services"
-   ##### "Too many irrelevant ADs"

#### `It is supposed to be a clearing house for people to vent their frustrations about some regular features of phones and rate the worst of them!`

### What Makes It Unique?

#### `It is a fun and understandable project for all those who ever got really angry or frustrated over the several other features of their telephones and serves as a podium for not only ranting but also for the audience to get engaged in really annoying features based on votes and contributions by others. It will blend humor and problem solving by letting users express their reactions to their current phones without really wheedling and threatening to transform it into something deep.`

### How could this theme fit inside the requirements?

#### Backend Work:

-   ##### `Logging user profiles with what they have added or voted on is an easy assignment.`
-   ##### `User data will be held against features they hate most and the scores.`
-   ##### `Does all Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations based on the feature's unit through one single API, but it will also have point value processing.`

#### Front-End Work:

-   ##### `It is a plant where all the features of the most spoken phone up to date will be seen.`
-   ##### `Users can view and delete their submissions.`
-   ##### `Voting, users should be used for features that are under filter executed by max-voted features that is followed by most hated features.`
-   ##### `The easiest way to this feature can be done using the interface, where eventually you may regenerate the list, as well as keep the list updated in real-time.`

---

#### `What made me choose this idea is that everyone has their own peeve about a smartphone and the latter is funny and functional-the project idea injects a slice of the everyday humor in all the user's annoyances done over some specific phone features in a collective list. Furthermore, it's an interesting way to learn full-stack development while creating something people actually would enjoy using and interacting with!`
